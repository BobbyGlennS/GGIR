### For developers:
We work with [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) branching model.

Key steps:
1. Create your own working branch
2. Make your changes in that branch
3. Commit your changes to your working branch as long as you are not finished with your development
4. Make sure the release notes in NEWS.Rd are up to date
5. Run the tests and checks as CRAN, make sure they pass
6. Once your work is finished, make a pull request, such that another developer can review your changes before merging them with the master branch

### For end-users unfamiliar with GitHub:
If you would like to propose additional functionalities or report an issue. Go to [issues](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues) and create a new issue.
