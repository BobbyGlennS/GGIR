## Contribution guidelines:
Contributions are welcome.

### For developers:
We work with [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) branching model.

Key steps:
1. Create your own working branch
2. Make your changes in that branch
3. Commit your changes to your working branch as long as you are not finished with your development
4. Once your work is finished, make a pull request, such that another developer can review your changes before merging them with the master branch

### For end-users unfamiliar with GitHub:
If you would like to propose additional functionalities or report an issue. Go to [issues](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/issues) and create a new issue.

If you would like to propose changes to the text of the manual this is possible.
1. Please go to the [man](https://github.com/wadpac/GGIR/tree/master/man) folder which holds all the parts of the manual.
2. Go to the part of the manual you want to edit and click on edit button (little pencil symbol) and make your changes.
3. Once you are finished, scroll down and describe you update and select the radio button "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request". One of the developers will then be able to review your changes and merge them in the master version of the code.
4. Click the green button "Propose file changes"
